## loading color configs

Configuration file for grcat is determined by /etc/grc.conf or ~/.grc/grc.conf file.

## creating color configs

config files can be found at `/usr/share/grc`

Directories ~/.grc/, /usr/local/share/grc/, /usr/share/grc/ are searched for the file (in this order). If the file is not found, it is assumed to be an absolute path of a configuration file located elsewhere.
